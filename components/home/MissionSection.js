            <p className="body-text mb-6">
              Caring Faith Children Centre (CFCC) was established to provide support and hope to less privileged children. 
              The organization's founding was inspired by a poignant story that deeply moved its founders, motivating them 
              to take action and help children facing similar circumstances.
            </p>
            <p className="body-text mb-6">
              With the support of family and friends, CFCC was formed to create a healthy environment that addresses 
              the holistic needs of these children. The organization is also committed to sharing its model and lessons 
              learned with others who wish to establish similar centers.
